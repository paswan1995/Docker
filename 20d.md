         – white
     
       * Complex
        
           * list/array
           * map/dictionary/object

* Extension of YAML files is `.yaml` or `.yml.` YAML is a text file
* Simple yaml

* YAML will be used to define kuberentes manifests and docker compose files
* YAML documentation from ansible refer here: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html

## Docker compose 

* This was external tool, but now it is integrated as docker subcommand `docker compose`
* Compose allows use to specify the yaml file which helps in creating the below by specifying in a yaml file
       * networks
       * volumes
       * containers
 
* docker compose file will have the name of `docker-compose.yml`
* sample

* to start all the containers create a folder copy the docker-compose.yaml and execute docker compose up -d and to remove every thing docker compose down
* for the compose file with instructions to run student course register which we have executed manually yesterday
