##            Docker             

## Application Deployments

__Terms__:

* Capex: Captial Expenditure = this refer to the organisation done purchasing servers
* Opex: Operational Expenditure = which your organisation does to maintain servers 
* Physical Server
* Hypervisor = hypervisor is a software that is use to create virtual machines 
       * There are 2 types of Hypervisor 
          * 1 which you directly install on physical server and then create a vm
          * 2nd is which you install top of the operating system to create vm 
* Virtual Machine
* Return on Investment (ROI)

__Evolution__

* Generation 1: 
       * Directly run on Physical Servers
       * If your application is not utilizing hardware completely, ROI is very long

* Generation 2: 
       *  Hypervisors create virtual machines and applications installed in virtual machines

* Hypervisors perform hardware virtualizationa and provide
       * virtual cpu
       * virtual disk
       * virtual ram
       * virtual network

* In the isolated area created by hypervisor, we can install os and necessary softwares
* Application can be installed and used from here
* Better ROI

* Generation 3:
       * Containers: These are isolated areas which look like vms but the container is an isolated area which has virtualized os.
       * Applications running in Containers will not feel the difference
       * We can run more applications on a single box

## What is docker?

* Docker (dock worker) is used to create containers which is standard way of packaging any application

* Application can be any of the below but have a standard way of packaging i.e docker image
       * developed in any technology
       * develop in any server

* Packaging in docker image format helps us to run our application

## Expectations from you in terms of Docker

* Containerize any application run by your organization.
* Manage Data, Security and Networks for containerized applications.
* To acheive the above expectations, we need to use
       * docker can understand how it runs and creates containers
       * play with docker aroud networks, data and security
       * apply them to our application. 

## Run apache server (VM)

* Create a vm (ubuntu) and ssh into it

``sudo apt update`` 
``sudo apt install apache2 -y ``

* Now navigate to `http://<publicip>`
